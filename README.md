## Exchanges
As a general rule, the Verus community values decentralization, self-custody, and permissionlessness. Exchanges listed here are not necessarily endorsed by any contributors to this wiki. Do not mine to an exchange address, you'll have a bad time and since you've been warned people aren't likely to bend over backwards to help. Don't store your coins on an exchange, the Verus community has had several bad experiences with exchanges getting hacked, rugpulled, or simply providing poor support, locking funds up for months or more.
- The largest source of liquidity for VRSC is in on-chain liquidity baskets. The best path to take advantage of this is to bridge assets (like DAI, MKR, ETH) over to Verus from Ethereum and convert them into VRSC using the liquidity baskets.
- [SafeTrade](https://safe.trade/) - Safetrade offers DAI and ETH (vETH) withdrawals on the Verus network, this is an inexpensive and fast way to bring value into Verus for use in the ecosystem.
