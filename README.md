# VerusDirectory
This is a community-maintained list of resources for the Verus community. It is intended to be a quick way to find or re-find tools and information, to catalog receipts of what the Verus community has done, and provide a consolidated location for new community members that might like to deep-dive. Links and information appearing here are intended to be helpful, but should not be considered an endoresement by the owner or contributors of this repository. Everything in the Verus ecosystem is operated by independent community members.
